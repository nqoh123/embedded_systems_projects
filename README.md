# LED Blinking on 8051 Microcontroller

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using the 8051 microcontroller (AT89C51).  
The program is written in C and simulated using Proteus.

## 🛠️ Tools & Components
- AT89C51 Microcontroller
- Keil uVision IDE (for coding & compiling)
- Proteus (for simulation)
- LED + Resistor + Crystal Oscillator

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Open the code in **Keil uVision** and compile.
2. Load the generated HEX file into the Proteus microcontroller.
3. Run the simulation in Proteus.
4. Observe the LED blinking.
